# Shoppimon Event Hub Project
This is an Event Hub project that will create a unified system for tracking Shoppimon’s own user activity, clearly, simply and in a scalable manner over time. This will help the whole Shoppimon team gain an in depth understanding of how the company’s customer’s behave when using the system, and will incorporate data through integrations across multiple 3rd party services, including Google Analytics and Intercom.
